Dr. Smith: Alright, Mr. Sabelli, please come in and have a seat. How have you been feeling overall since your last visit?

Mr. Sabelli: Hi Dr. Smith, I've been feeling well in general.

Dr. Smith: Okay, let's take a look at your blood work. Everything generally looks good, but I do see a couple of things we should address. Your iron level is a little low, which can sometimes lead to fatigue and weakness. Also, your B12 is also a bit lower than we'd like to see.

For the low iron, I'm going to recommend an iron supplement. You should take one tablet daily, preferably on an empty stomach with some vitamin C, like a glass of orange juice, to help with absorption.

For the B12, we can also start you on a B12 supplement that you can take daily.

Now, how has your back been feeling? Are you still continuing with physiotherapy?

Mr. Sabelli: I'm still keeping up with physiotherapy and my back has been feeling much better. I was actually wondering, I can't remember if I've had my second measeles vaccine as a child. Would I be able to get a second dose today?

Dr. Smith: We can definitely get you a measles vaccine today. Let me just have the nurse come in shortly to administer that for you after we finish up here. Anything else I can do for you today?

Mr. Sabelli: no that is all, thank you.

Dr. Smith: Okay then we'll see you back in another 6 months to follow up on your back and check your iron and b12 levels. You can make an appointment up at the front.
