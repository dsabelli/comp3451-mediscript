Dr. Lee: Hi Sarah, welcome back. How are you feeling today?

Sarah Miller: Hello Dr. Lee. I've had a bit of a persistent cough for the past couple of weeks, and it seems to be getting a little worse at night. I also feel a bit more tired than usual.

Dr. Lee: Okay, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in... and out. Again... and out. Hmm, sounds a little congested. Have you had any fever or sore throat?

Sarah Miller: No fever, but I did have a bit of a scratchy throat initially, which has mostly gone away now.

Dr. Lee: Alright. To be safe, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any infection. We'll also do a quick swab for flu and strep, just in case. In the meantime, I recommend you try a humidifier at home and get plenty of rest and fluids. If your cough worsens significantly or you develop a fever, please call us.

Sarah Miller: Okay, that sounds good. When should I expect the results?

Dr. Lee: The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours for the X-ray. We'll call you with the results as soon as we have them. The swab results should be back sooner, likely within the day. Do you have any other concerns today?

Sarah Miller: No, that's all. Thank you, Dr. Lee.

Dr. Lee: You're welcome, Sarah. Take care.
