Dr. Patel: Good afternoon, Mr. Chen. How are things going with your blood pressure medication?

Mr. Chen: Good afternoon, Dr. Patel. Overall, I think it's been working well. My readings at home have been consistently lower than before.

Dr. Patel: That's excellent to hear. Let's take your blood pressure now. Okay, 125 over 78. That looks much better than your last visit. You mentioned you were feeling a little lightheaded occasionally?

Mr. Chen: Yes, sometimes when I stand up too quickly. It doesn't last long, but it's a bit concerning.

Dr. Patel: That can sometimes happen as your body adjusts to the lower blood pressure. We might need to make a small adjustment to your dosage. You're currently on 10 milligrams of lisinopril, correct?

Mr. Chen: Yes, that's right.

Dr. Patel: Let's try reducing it to 7.5 milligrams daily for the next month and see if that helps with the lightheadedness while still keeping your blood pressure in a good range. Please continue to monitor your blood pressure at home and keep a log. If the lightheadedness persists or your blood pressure starts to creep up again, please let us know. Do you have enough medication to last you until your next appointment?

Mr. Chen: Yes, I think so. Thank you, Dr. Patel.

Dr. Patel: You're welcome, Mr. Chen. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to check on your blood pressure and how you're feeling. Please see the receptionist on your way out to book that.
